## App link:
The link to the running Shiny app of my dashboard is:

## Assignment option and dataset:
My choice is Option B - my own Shiny app of penguins.
Dataset: palmerpenguins from palmerpenguins package.

## Description:

_This app analyzes the palmerpenguins data based on bill lengths._
It has many functions:
1. It illustrates three outputs:
     * a *box plot* of bill length by species.
     * a *summarize table* grouped by species and islands. 
     * a *full data table*.
2. A *slider input* to select the max bill length in data. By this function, we can see different plots and data in different subsets of bill length to _gain insights in analysis_.
3. A *check box* input to sort the table by islands. Sometimes, we want to compare the data on the same island and the sorted table is more _clear to compare_ on this.
4. A *penguin image* to make our dashboard more _interesting and to align with the topic_.
5. *Separating tabs*. Because I have two tables and one plot, separating tabs to show them _makes the dashboard clear and pretty_.
