### Penguin Analysis Dashboard

## App link:
The link to the running Shiny app of my dashboard is:
https://zzh2015.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-BearAlenko/

## Assignment option and dataset:
* My choice is Option B - my own Shiny app of penguins.
* Dataset: palmerpenguins from [palmerpenguins package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

## Description:

_This app analyzes the palmerpenguins data based on bill lengths._
It has many functions:
1. It illustrates three outputs:
     * a **box plot** of bill length by species.
     * a **summarize table** grouped by species and islands. 
     * a **full data table**.
2. A **slider input** to select the max bill length in data. By this function, we can see different plots and data in different subsets of bill length to **gain insights in analysis**.
3. A **check box** input to sort the table by islands. Sometimes, we want to compare the data on the same island and the sorted table is more **clear to compare** on this.
4. A **penguin image** to make our dashboard more **interesting and to align with the topic**.
5. **Separating tabs**. Because I have two tables and one plot, separating tabs to show them **makes the dashboard clear and pretty**.
